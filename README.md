# sqlalchemy-challenge
 In this challenge, we used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. The specific tools we used include SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

 We also designed a Flask API to design a climate app using python.
